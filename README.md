We are aiming to create the simplest yet most detailed app to manage your time for all your activities in life. You can use this app as a to-do list, calendar, habit tracker, pomodoro timer for focus mode, and you can review statistics that reflect your efforts at any given time. 

This app is continuously being developed and refined. In the future, the app will be available on multiple platforms such as iOS, MacOS, Windows, Linux... and you will be able to sync data across all platforms.

**THE DIFFERENCE COMPARED TO THOUSANDS OF OTHER TIME MANAGEMENT APPLICATIONS?**

This application can help you create, track, and edit every detail in your long-term plans or daily activities in a flexible and natural way.

For example, in your studies, you need to read a book within a certain period of time.

Day 1:

Time: 9-11am. Read chapters 1,2. Location: school library. Note: remember to bring your student card to borrow books at the library

Time: 3-5pm. Read chapter 3. Location: Cafeteria.

Time: 8-9pm. Continue reading chapter 3. Location: At home.

Day 2:

Time: 8-10am. Read chapter 4. Location: At home.

Day 3:…

You can create a list named 'Research and Study' and add a task 'Read a book' with details as above. When you want to track or change the plan for the task 'Read a book', you just need to click on the item of the task 'Read a book' and review all the details of this task. You can also review the time frames of this task on the daily, weekly, or monthly calendar screens.

Another example for tracking your daily activities. You want to plan for the Squat exercise as below:

Monday:

Time: 6-7pm. Goal: at least 100 times. Location: gym room. Note: don’t forget to bring a water bottle!

Wednesday:

Time: 12-1pm. Goal: at least 50 times. Location: at home.

Friday:

Time: 6pm- unknown end time. Goal: at least 100 times. Location: at home.

Sunday: …

You can create a list named ‘Workout’ and add a quantitative task with the title ‘Squat’ and add all the details in the plan above. Your plans will be displayed as below:
