We hope this application will be useful for you in managing your time, helping you achieve many important goals in life, and of course, don’t forget to take time to enjoy your life.

We’re glad to hear that you find the application useful! Your support and feedback are greatly appreciated. If you enjoy using the app, please consider rating it on the app store and sharing it with your friends. This helps us reach more people and continue to improve the app. 

We understand the importance of a clean, ad-free user experience, and we strive to maintain this. However, the development and maintenance of the app do require financial resources. If you’re able to, consider upgrading to the paid version of the software or buying us a cup of coffee. Your support goes a long way in helping us continue to develop and improve the app. Thank you!
